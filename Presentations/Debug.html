                Because programming has the expectation of being difficult, I
                intend to reduce this association by providing my perspective
                and the thought process I use to debug computer programs. My
                focus is for you to understand the reasoning behind each step
                more than the steps themselves so you remain flexable when
                facing different problems even those outside of programming. To
                illistrate I will guide you through a recent problem I had
                concerning my StarCraft bot. You will not see any code or the
                details of each step. If you have a question please ask as an early
                misunderstanding may prevent a mind blowing revelation.

                The steps I take are: define the problem, modify and test,
                devising a solution, and implement and asses. The first step
                define the problem aims at gathering information about the
                problem. If we don't understand why its a problem and the
                sequence of events leading to it, how could we ever fix it
                effectively?

            <aside class="notes">
                In this example what is the problem? Well some bases are
                not gathering resources. For those haven't played Starcraft
                resources are the currency used to build and train stuff.
                There are two types, minerals the abundant blue crystals
                and vespene gas the three volcano-ish thing and both need
                workers to gather them.<br />
                Why is it a problem or bug? Because a base is a large
                investment about 400 minerals. That would take a single
                worker about 50 mining trips to recover the expense. The
                resources would've been better used for something else in
                this case.<br />
                We expect the base to train workers that would gather the
                minerals improving our economic income for more building
                and training. Otherwise the spent minerals for the base are
                waisted.<br />
                What is cause? Well there were two causes at play. The
                method of detecting the minerals is situationally faulty.
                If no minerals are detected nearby than no workers are
                trained to gather them. On the right the poor base
                placement is an additional cause. Poor placement because
                the distance to gather resources is longer than necessary
                meaning that our economic income will be slower or more
                workers are required to compensate.<br />
                What is our target solution? The target I will guide you
                through is to improve the base placement. Why? Because the
                other cause was due to a some missed logic that once
                defined was easy to correct. Improving base placement
                provides a good perspective of each step.<br />

                I use this step for implementing quick fixes or for discovering
                how something operates. Similar to the scientific method I will
                make a small change thinking it will solve the problem. By
                testing and observing its outcome I can make logical deductions
                about what is happening and the effect it just had.</br>
                Tools were created to allow us to interact with the game
                programmatically otherwise it would not be possible to
                build this bot. One of the tools will find a location for a
                desired building within range of a given position.
                Originally I was giving it the average position of minerals
                and building the base at its determined location.
