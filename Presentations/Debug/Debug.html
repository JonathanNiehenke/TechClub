            Because programming has the expectation of being difficult, I
            intend to reduce this association by providing my perspective
            and the thought process I use to debug computer programs. My
            focus is for you to understand the reasoning behind each step
            more than the steps themselves so you remain flexable when
            facing different problems even those outside of programming. To
            illistrate I will guide you through a recent problem I had
            concerning my StarCraft bot. You will not see any code or the
            details of each step. If you have a question please ask as an early
            misunderstanding may prevent a mind blowing revelation.

    <h1>The Steps</h1>
    <div id="Steps" name="tabMenu">
        <h2>Define the problem</h2>
        <div>
            <p class="Annotations">
                The steps I take are: define the problem, modify and test,
                devising a solution, and implement and asses. The first step
                define the problem aims at gathering information about the
                problem. If we don't understand why its a problem and the
                sequence of events leading to it, how could we ever fix it
                effectively?
            </p>
            <h4>In this example</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>What is the problem/bug?</strong>
                    <span  onclick="replace.call(this)">...</span>
                    <span class=hide>
                        Some bases are not gathering resources.
                    </span>
                </li>
                <p class="Annotations">
                    In this example what is the problem? Well some bases are
                    not gathering resources. For those haven't played Starcraft
                    resources are the currency used to build and train stuff.
                    There are two types, minerals the abundant blue crystals
                    and vespene gas the three volcano-ish thing and both need
                    workers to gather them.
                </p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Why is it a problem/bug?</strong>
                    <span  onclick="replace.call(this)">...</span>
                    <span class=hide>
                        We are waisting minerals used to build the base.
                    </span>
                </li>
                <p class="Annotations">
                    Why is it a problem or bug? Because a base is a large
                    investment about 400 minerals. That would take a single
                    worker about 50 mining trips to recover the expense. The
                    resources would've been better used for something else in
                    this case.
                </p>
                <li>
                    <strong>What was expected?</strong> 
                    <span  onclick="replace.call(this)">...</span>
                    <span class=hide>
                        The base train workers and improve our economy.
                    </span>
                </li>
                <p class="Annotations">
                    We expect the base to train workers that would gather the
                    minerals improving our economic income for more building
                    and training. Otherwise the spent minerals for the base are
                    waisted.
                </p>
                <li>
                    <strong>What is the cause?</strong>
                    <span  onclick="replace.call(this)">...</span>
                    <span class=hide>
                        The base missed seeing the resources we would gather.
                    </span>
                </li>
                <p class="Annotations">
                    What is cause? Well there were two causes at play. The
                    method of detecting the minerals is situationally faulty.
                    If no minerals are detected nearby than no workers are
                    trained to gather them. On the right the poor base
                    placement is an additional cause. Poor placement because
                    the distance to gather resources is longer than necessary
                    meaning that our economic income will be slower or more
                    workers are required to compensate.
                </p>
                <li>
                    <strong>What is our target solution?</strong>
                    <span  onclick="replace.call(this)">...</span>
                    <span class=hide>
                        Improve the accuracy of the base placement.
                    </span>
                </li>
                <p class="Annotations">
                    What is our target solution? The target I will guide you
                    through is to improve the base placement. Why? Because the
                    other cause was due to a some missed logic that once
                    defined was easy to correct. Improving base placement
                    provides a good perspective of each step.

                I use this step for implementing quick fixes or for discovering
                how something operates. Similar to the scientific method I will
                make a small change thinking it will solve the problem. By
                testing and observing its outcome I can make logical deductions
                about what is happening and the effect it just had.

                <span  onclick="replace.call(this)">Audience input...</span>
                <span class=hide>Of a direction to solve the problem.</span>

                <strong>Modifying and Testing:</strong>
                <span  onclick="replace.call(this)">Audience input...</span>
                <span class=hide>
                    Of a misunderstanding in our logic.
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Devising a solution:</strong> 
                <span  onclick="replace.call(this)">Audience input...</span>
                <span class=hide>
                    How to simplify the problem by using what we knew.

            <li>
                <strong>Implementing/Testing/Assessing:</strong>
                <span  onclick="replace.call(this)">Audience input...</span>
                <span class=hide>
                    There are still problems, but it is an improvement.

                <strong>Finally:</strong>
                <span  onclick="replace.call(this)">...</span>
                <span class=hide>
                    Reach for good enough, because every little improvement is
                    closer to perfection.
