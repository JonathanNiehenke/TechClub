# Presonal Tech Club Contributions

Here are my personal contributions to Technology Club.

### Developed by:
Jonathan Niehenke

### Disclaimer:
The screen shot are the only images of my own. Otherwise they were found through Google and used for educational and demonstrative purposes.

## Projects
- Launch into Programming - A dynamic web page with instructions and links to begin programming in C++, C#, Java, JavaScript and Python.
- PiCalc - A demonstration of Pi algorithms and how quickly they calculate its digits.
- PiScanner - A attendance assist to club advisors with security in mind.
- Presentations - A collection of presentations about different aspects of programming.
- Snake - A game of snake and moderate ai.
- Sorting - A sorting demonstration of bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort, mergesort and more.
- SVD image compression - A demonstration of image compression by using Singular Value Decomposition
