<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    Yo-yos among dolls, balls and kites are the oldest toys. Fundimentally, it
    uses the rotational motion obtained from going down the string to return
    back up. Over the years improvements in material and design have greatly
    improved spin times and stability.
</p>
<h2 >Materials</h2>
<p>
    Yo-yo's began as wood and ceramics. Today, they are from plastics and
    metals. Since then ball bearings reduce the friction between the string and
    the axel. The friction/responce system allows for the spinning yo-yo to grip
    the string and to roll up it. Improvements hide the response system away out
    of reach of the string until actions force the string to it. Additional,
    materials like plastics and metals.
</p>
<h2 >Yoyo Styles</h2>
<div id="Styles" name="tabContainer">
<h4>Looping</h4>
<p>
    Tricks are centered around flicking the yo-yo back away as it returns so
    that it never actually enters your grasp. Done repeatedly. Example tricks:
    Milking the Cow, Punching bag, Shoot the Moon and Three Leaf Clover.
</p>
<h4>String</h4>
<p>
    Tricks are cenered around landing/restringing the string back into the
    yo-yo's center. Most common type of trick. Example tricks:
    Man on flying trapeeze, Double or Nothing, Hudini Mount.
</p>
<h4>Free-Hand</h4>
<p>
    Preformed with the string attatched to a counter weight that when needed is
    held. Tricks have the counter weight spinning and moving around just like
    yo-yo.
</p>
<h4>Off-String</h4>
<p>
    Preformed with the string not attached to the yo-yo. Tricks have the yo-yo
    flying beyond the range of the string. A "bind" is preformed for the yo-yo
    to return. Yo-yo's are usually made of durable plasic lined with rubber.

        <td>
            The shape focuses the weight nearest the center. Good for looping.
        </td>

        <td>Modified</td>
        <td>
        </td>
        <td>
            The shape has near elliptical halves, which focues the weight
            slightly away from the center.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>O-Butterfly</td>
        <td>
        </td>
        <td>
            The shape flares away from the center in a curve. The widened
            landing gap is easier to thread the string back through. Weight is
            focused on the rims to increase spin times and improve stability
            while the yo-yo is threaded and sitting on the string.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>V-Butterfly</td>
        <td>
        </td>
        <td>
            The shape flares away from the center in a straight line. Improves
            on the O-Butterfly by being more stable when preforming tricks very
            very quickly. Disadvantages are it does not feel comfortable while
            being held.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>H-Butterfly</td>
        <td>
        </td>
        <td>
            The shape flares away from the center with a "step". Improves on
            the other butterfly shapes by having more weight closr to the rims,
            which impoves spin times. Also it is more stable than the
            O-Butterfly and more comfortable than the V-Butterfly.

            First butterfly yo-yo. Played with it so much it broke. But with it
            learned some string trick fundimentals and mounts.

            I like its large size, great for any yo-yo beginner. With it I
            improved my string trick fundimentals and mounts. Probably, the only
            yo-yo released in 2003 and still in production.

            Disliked its small size and vibration. It is the cheap plasic
            version of the "Hitman" which was the yoyo at the time. I keep
            sentimentally.

            Awesome yo-yo. Almost no vibration restarted my Yo-Yo hobby after
            eight years. Seems distructive to silicone brake pad response system
            as I am continuiously replacing it.
